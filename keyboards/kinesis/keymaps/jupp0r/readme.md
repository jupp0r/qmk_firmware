# Jupp's Kinesis mapping

This is my custom mapping for the kinesis advantage modified with the kint controller board.

-   DVORAK layout from the Kinesis software, but remapped in a way that lets me
    use the "dvorak" layout on MacOS so I don't have to software switch keyboard
    layouts when moving from the built in keyboard to the Advantage 2 on my
    MacBook.
-   Media keys mapped to be not on a layer
-   Caps Lock mapped to ESC (because who needs Caps Lock)
